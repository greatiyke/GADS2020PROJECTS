GETTING STARTED WITH APP ENGINE
OBJECTIVES
1. Preview an App engine application running locally in cloud shell
2. Deploy an App engine application, so that others can reach it
3. Disable an App engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible
1. To initialize an APP Engine 
#in GCP console on the top right toolbar check the open cloud shell button, then click continue
#list the active account with with 
gcloud auth list
#list the project ID with 
gcloud config list project
#you can configure your project ID with
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID  #NOTE your project ID is listed at the top left in your GCP console
#initialize the APP engine with your project and choose the region you want the APP to be located
gcloud App create --project = $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
#when prompted select the region where you want the your app engine app located
#clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello-world directory
git clone https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/python-docs-sample
#navigate to the source directory
cd python-docs-samples/app engine/standard_python3/hello_world
2. Run hello world application locally
#in the cloud shell command execute the following command to download and upgrade the packages list
sudo apt-get update
#set up a virtual environment in which you will ru your application, python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system
sudo apt-get install virtualen #if prompted y/n press y and then enter
virtualenv -p python3 venv
#activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
#navigate to your project directory and install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
#run the application 
python main.py  #ignoring the warning if any
#in cloud shell check web preview >preview on port 8080 to preview the app
#return to cloud shell and press ctrl-c to abort the deployed services
2b. Deploy and run hello world on app engine
#navigate to the source directory
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
#Deploy your hellow world application
gcloud app deployed
#launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJET_ID appspot.com
gcloud app browse
#copy and paste the url into a new browser window
3. Disable the application
#App engine offers no option to undeploy an application, however you can disable the application which causes it to no longer be accessible to users
#in the cloud console on the navigation menu click app engine >settings click disable application
#read the dialog message enter the App ID and click disable, if you refresh the browser you will get a 404 error
